# Amazon-Scraper

## Project Status: Discontinued

This project was an attempt to scrape product images from Amazon using PHP cURL for educational and personal learning purposes only.

## Why the Project Was Dropped

Amazon has implemented advanced anti-bot and anti-scraping protections that block automated requests, even when using legitimate user-agents and browser headers. As a result, it is no longer technically feasible to reliably scrape product images or data from Amazon using this approach.

**We do not encourage or support any illegal activity.** This project was never intended for commercial use or to violate Amazon's terms of service. It was discontinued as soon as it became clear that scraping Amazon is both technically blocked and against their policies.

## Recommendation

If you need Amazon product data, consider using their official [Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/advertising/api) which is designed for this purpose and complies with their terms.
